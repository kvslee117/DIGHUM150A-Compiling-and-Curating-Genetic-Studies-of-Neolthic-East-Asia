# DIGHUM150A-Compiling-and-Curating-Genetic-Studies-of-Neolthic-East-Asia

Here, I am attempting to host a collection of recently published genetic studies that take place in Neolithic East Asia this year and previous years.  East Asia has a wide variety of regions and environments that are especially of interest to study and compare various populations with each other as well as to modern populations.  This will help elucidate origins of the populations of interest in the papers as well as the origins of modern populations at question.  As well as providing ways to imagine what peoples of these ancient cultures resembled and how the societies of these archaeological cultures can be reconstructed to look like, based on many of the hints and clues generated from research conducted by the authors of these papers.
